## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dorukdogular/focusmocus/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dorukdogular/focusmocus/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement. Please provide a clear description of the enhancement and its potential benefits.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Make sure your code lints.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style.
- Use Prettier or a similar formatter if one is configured for the project.
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code where necessary.

Thank you for your contribution!
